From the end of our driveway we are only 100m to the beautiful Pubic Gardens and from there only a hop, skip and jump to Rockwood Park. Once you enter the park you will see a wide range of roads and trails around Lily Lake and Lilys Cafe. Swimming is also a great option in Lily Lake and Fisher Lake with great beaches to relax on.</p>
